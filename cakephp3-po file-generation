2. aftrer these commands  default.pot file  will create src/Locale .according to language we need to create one folder in "Locale".

for example if we want arabic language translation we need to create  Locale/ar 

3. copy default.pot file into Locale/ar folder and rename  it as default.po

4. in default.po   will have msgid and msgstr  change as below

   example : msgid "Home"
             msgstr "الصفحة الرئيسية" 

5. after modifications  need to clear tmp/cache/models and tmp/cache/persistent  every time.

Steps followed in  controller 

 1. paste below lines in in AppController.php

use Cake\I18n\I18n; 

 public function beforeFilter(Event $event)
  {
        $session = $this->request->session();
       	if ($session->read('language') == 'ar'  && ($this->request->params['controller'] == 'particular controller name')) 
        {
               I18n::locale('ar');
        } else {
               I18n::locale('en_US');
        }
   }

note : if  total website need to translate then no need to give controller condition.

2. where we want translation in that particular controller 
  
 $session->write('language','your page language');

Steps followed in  view pages

Labels shoud be echo __('Label'); format

problem : some time session language won't change immediately  
solution: if this problem arises then need to reload page only once 

<script type="text/javascript">
$( window ).load(function() {
    if (window.location.href.indexOf('reload')==-1) {
         window.location.replace(window.location.href+'?reload');
    }
});
</script>
